This directory is for keys that you want to use as part of SSH tunnels that you need to setup.

Make sure this directory is only accessible by users with the right permissions.

The best option is to use the `config` entry to point to a ssh-config file that is used for the connection.
This allows to set more advanced options, such as keep alive.

For example:

Host snupydb
    ForwardX11 no
    HostName SOME_IP_ADRESS
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    Compression yes
    CompressionLevel 9

To create a key do the following

> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /var/www-snupy-aqua/config/tunnels/keys/production
> ssh-copy-id -i production user@host
